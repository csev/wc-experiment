<h1>Dr. Chuck Explores Web Components</h1>
<p>
I really want to use web components so I can build applications where thee UI can be dramatically
restructured by applying a different layer of web components to the markup without changing the
markup or web service APIs that support the markup.
</p>
<p>
My goal is to be able to use the same markup to format a hierarchical threaded disussion to look like
<a href="images/slack.png" target="_blank">Slack</a> or <a href="images/piazza.png" target="_blank">Piazza</a>.
</p>
<p>
It is my hope to provide my thread discussion tool that generates web-component markup and
a set of extendable/ replaceable web components to significantly reshape or refactor a
threaded discussion UI.
</p>
<p>This is all in github at

feel free to open an issue to talk about what I am trying to do.</p>
